# ic-js

A collection of library for interfacing with the Internet Computer

The libraries are still in active development, and new features will incrementally be available.

## Libraries

- [nns-js](/packages/nns-js): interfacing with the **ledger** and **governance** canisters of the IC
- sns-js: interacting with a Sns project (_coming soon_)
- cmc-js: querying the Cmc canister (_coming soon_)

## Integration with NNS-dapp

These packages are used in [NNS-dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/). Checkout the [How-To](/HOWTO.md) if you wish to test local changes with the app.
