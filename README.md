## Installation

Install any library of this repo in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
npm i @dfinity/utils
npm i @dfinity/ledger-icp
npm i @dfinity/ledger-icrc
npm i @dfinity/nns-proto @dfinity/nns
npm i @dfinity/sns
npm i @dfinity/cmc
npm i @dfinity/ckbtc
```

You may be using all libraries in your project - as we do in [NNS-dapp](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/).
That is s why, to help tree-shaking and avoid duplication of code, the libraries of this project are referencing [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js) and [utils](/packages/utils) as peer dependencies.

Therefore, be sure that the needed `agent-js` and [utils](/packages/utils) dependencies are available in your project or install these as following:

```bash
npm i @dfinity/agent @dfinity/candid @dfinity/principal @dfinity/utils
```
