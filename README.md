- [nns](/packages/nns): interfacing with the **ledger** and **governance** canisters of the IC
- [sns](/packages/sns): interacting with a Service Nervous System (SNS) project
- cmc: querying the Cmc canister (_coming soon_)
- [utils](/packages/utils): a collection of utilities and constants for NNS/SNS projects.
