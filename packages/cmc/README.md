## Installation

You can use `cmc-js` by installing it in your project.

```

The bundle needs peer dependencies, be sure that following resources are available in your project as well.

```bash

```

## Usage

The features are available through the class `CMCCanister`. It has to be instantiated with the canister ID of the cycles minting canister. On `mainnet`, its ID is `rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai`.

e.g. querying the current Icp to cycles conversion rate.

```ts
import { CMCCanister } from "@dfinity/cmc";
import { createAgent } from "@dfinity/utils";

const agent = await createAgent({
  identity,
  host: HOST,
});

const { getIcpToCyclesConversionRate } = CMCCanister.create({
  agent,
  canisterId: CYCLES_MINTING_CANISTER_ID,
});

const rate = await getIcpToCyclesConversionRate();
```
