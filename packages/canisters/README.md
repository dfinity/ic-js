## Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Unified interface** for interacting with core Internet Computer canisters
- üß© **Modular structure** with independent sub-packages
- üîÑ **Always up to date** with the latest Candid declarations
- üß™ **Battle-tested and verified on-chain** through production dapps

## Installation

You can use the library by installing it in your project.

```bash
npm i @icp-sdk/canisters
```

This library has several peer dependencies. Make sure the following packages are also installed in your project:

```bash
npm i @dfinity/ckbtc @dfinity/cketh @dfinity/cmc @dfinity/ic-management @dfinity/ledger-icp @dfinity/ledger-icrc @dfinity/nns @dfinity/sns @dfinity/utils @icp-sdk/core
```

## Usage

The SDK re-exports modules for core Internet Computer canisters and exposes them as sub-entries. Each sub-entry corresponds to a specific canister library.

Import the desired module directly from its entry point and refer to its individual documentation for details.

## Example

Here's for example how to use the ckETH module through its sub-entry:

```typescript
import { CkETHMinterCanister } from "@icp-sdk/canisters/cketh";
import { createAgent } from "@dfinity/utils";

const agent = await createAgent({
  identity,
  host: HOST,
});

const { getSmartContractAddress } = CkETHMinterCanister.create({
  agent,
  canisterId: MY_CKETH_MINTER_CANISTER_ID,
});

const address = await getSmartContractAddress({});
```

Similarly, the ICP and ICRC ledgers can be used as follows, with the slight difference that their imports are nested under a common parent.

```typescript
import { IcrcLedgerCanister } from "@icp-sdk/canisters/ledger/icrc";
import { createAgent } from "@dfinity/utils";

const agent = await createAgent({
  identity,
  host: HOST,
});

const { metadata } = IcrcLedgerCanister.create({
  agent,
  canisterId: MY_LEDGER_CANISTER_ID,
});

const data = await metadata({});
```
