## Breaking Changes

- Various Candid-inherited types are no longer expressed as unions and resolves to a single type. For example: `Uint8Array` instead of `Uint8Array | number[]`.
- The `canisterStatus` function interface was modified to introduce support for query calls.

## Upgrading from `@dfinity/*` libraries

If you are upgrading from `@dfinity/*` libraries, have a look at the [Upgrading to v1](./v1.md) guide.
