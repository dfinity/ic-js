## Breaking changes

- Rename values of enum Topic and NnsFunction to match the backend values.
- Use different request/response types for NNS Governance proposals, and different fields for `InstallCode` proposals.
- The `getUtxos` parameter `filter.min_confirmations` has been renamed to `filter.minConfirmations` for consistency with

  performed by the canister. This is why `getUtxos` now only supports non-certified calls and has been renamed to
  `getUtxosQuery`.

  by the SNS Aggregator.

  neuron operation, and `Neuron::visibility` attribute.
- Add function `getBalanceQuery` to `BitcoinCanister` object of package `@dfinity/ckbtc`, that implements the
  `bitcoin_get_balance_query` method of the IC Bitcoin API.

  see [documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-canister-info)).
- `@dfinity/nns-proto` was updated with the most recent proto types, some of which were not backwards compatible.
- The size of the nns-proto-js library has noticeably increased, as it now exposes all types instead of just a manually
  picked subset.

## Features

- Update Candid definition in ckBTC, ckETH, CMC, ICP and ICRC Ledgers, Nns and Sns.
- Add "Subnet Rental" to the list of `NnsFunction` and to topic support.

  is now required.

  transactions.
- Potential errors thrown by `withdrawEth` provide now unparsed details.

## Features

- ICP transactions, as provided by the Index canister, have been extended to include their block timestamp information.

  fetching the fee from the network.
- Remove hardware wallet specific code paths from `@dfinity/ledger-icp`.
- Remove hardware wallet specific options from LedgerCanister.
- Remove dependency on `@dfinity/nns-proto` from `@dfinity/ledger-icp`.

- Set number of retries to 10 (as opposed to default 3) in `createAgent` utility to make the agent more resilient
  against watermark check failures.

## Build

- Upgrade `agent-js` dependencies to `v1.2.1`. Note that it is advised to set the number of retries of the agent to 10
  to prevent the potential issue
  `Timestamp failed to pass the watermark after retrying the configured 3 times. We cannot guarantee the integrity of the response since it could be a replay attack.` (
  see thread on
  the [forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/timestamp-failed-to-pass-the-watermark-after-retrying-the-configured-3-times/29180/3?u=peterparker)).
- Upgrade `didc` to `0.3.7` that converts candid files into JS and TS.
